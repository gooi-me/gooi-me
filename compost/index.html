                <p>Hi Gooi Friends and Family!</p>
              </strong>
              <p>
                My name is Kobus, I take some of the Gooi deliveries and facilitate the scraps to scrumptious compost
                transition. The bulk of gooi scraps goes to <a href="https://soilforlife.co.za/">Soil for Life</a>, but every second Wednesday and Thursday the dropoff comes to me! I'm excited to share some of what makes me incredibly stoked about soil, compost and the gooi project.
              </p>

              <p><u>Some Context!</u></p>
              <p>
                Entropy broadly refers to the tendency towards disorder and dissipation of useful energy (bear with me). On
                the whole, the universe tends towards entropy - the universe is cooling down, stars burn themselves out, and
                things (atoms) fall (drift) apart.

              </p>

              <p>
                An incredible exception to this trend is found with <em>Life</em> - It tends towards increasingly complex order and
                composition (sometimes referred to as syntropic rather than entropic).
              </p>
              <img src="../3.jpeg" alt="Leaf Icon" class='compost-image'>
              <p>
                A key aspect of these syntropic life systems is that they include a process that fully decomposes the complex
                compositions back into building blocks for future life composition.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
                Processes like photosynthesis and root nitrogen fixation further allow Life to pull additional building blocks
                out of the atmosphere so that after each round there are even more lego-bricks to play with.
                These decomposing processes involve a whole orchestra of different tiny life-forms from worms, to fungi, to
                bacteria, archaea, nematodes, and microarthropods. Given enough time this dream team can turn any complex
                organic compositions back into legos for Life to play with.
              </p>
              <p><u>Making Compost</u></p>
              <p>
                Composting is the process of setting up the ideal playground for the dream team to do what they do best.
                Whereas a pile of garden clippings will take about a year to turn into compost, the process used for maximum
                dream team action (The Berkeley Method of Hot Composting) gets that process down to around 20 days! We do this
                by getting a diversity of microbes (from horse manure, forest leaves, previous compost, and diverse bits of
                organic matter), giving them as much energy as they need (carbon in the form of wood shavings), and then loads
                and loads of nitrogen (Gooi food scraps) to help them access the carbon and make more microbes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Mixing all of
                this in a pile, oxygenating it with breathing vents, and turning the piles over every 2 days, gets
                us super nutrient rich compost that you can plant seeds directly into. These orchestras of decomposition often
                get up to 70/80 degrees Celsius and are even used in colder climates to heat greenhouses in winter.

                My sense is that gardening is generally the gateway to composting. Once you start growing things and wanting to
                grow more, the process of facilitating the flourish of Life quickly points you to home-cooking fertility (composting).

              Since starting to take the Gooi deliveries last year September I've felt like i'm sitting on endless
              potential!

            </p>

              So far we've fed around 30 Citrus and Olive trees and hopefully rejuvenating the slope they're on in the
              process.

              Planted loads of veggie seeds straight in the compost.

              And set up 3 new beds at the Oude Molen Eco village.

            <p><u>Thinking about compost and how cool it is</u></p>
            <p>
              Turning compost is a sweaty and involved process but contemplating the majesty of the processes at play
              definitely makes it worth it.

              Seeing food going from mostly fresh to totally indistinguishable from the rest of the pile in 3 weeks, while
              at the same time seeing a piece of plastic that found its way into the pile not change in the slightest, is
              always an interesting piece of thoughtfood. Funny also how it's mostly green plastics (shops tricking our old brains into thinking green is good). These are reminders to try consider circularity and contributing to the syntropy rather
              than entropy wherever we go (pee in the garden rather than in freshwater that gets flushed into the
              ocean, water your plants with dish or shower water!) Not because it's a bad thing to be part of the entropy (it's
              the general trend anyway) but because it feels great to contribute to the syntropy.
            </p>

              Having access to an abundance of compost has been a massive game changer and wouldn't be possible without the
              Gooi community. All of this life and abundance would have been lost to a landfill, and instead we have growth and possibility.
            </p>

              If you have a potential compost-intensive project you've been pondering (or if this post starts you on a
              journey of ponderings) I'd be very happy for you to reach out and try make it happen!
