            <h2>The Simple Solution to a Complex Waste Crisis:</h2>
            <h3>Turning Scraps into Soil</h3>
          </div>

            <div class = 'body-between-leaves'>
              <p>Have you ever considered that once upon a time, there was no such thing as food waste? All food was returned to earth as compost. There was a time before landfills and municipal rubbish trucks. Food was grown close by, every scrap was used, and the remains went into the garden or to the pigs. But, as cities grew, society became more industrialised, and whatever couldn't be accommodated in this new structure became "waste", and its disposal needed to be outsourced. At some point it seemed necessary to get a truck, take it out of urban centres, and throw it all into a pile never to be thought of again.
              </p>

              <p>
                Waste has always bothered me, the concept itself is unnatural. In the intricate dance of nature, waste as we know it doesn't exist. Whatever is eliminated or discarded by one creature, is used by another in a seamless cycle that has persisted for aeons. In contrast, humanity produces an immense amount of "waste" that disrupts the generative natural cycle. Food waste now goes into landfills where it breaks down without oxygen and becomes a source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that exacerbates the climate crisis. It also contaminates water as leachate seeps into the ground. What if we could reintroduce a practice so simple, yet so powerful, that it syncs us back into nature's rhythm?

              <p><strong>
                Enter "gooi."
              </strong></p>
              <p>
                Gooi is a new member of the Cape Town ecosystem, here to remind us that food waste is not actually waste, but valuable food for our microbial cousins in the soil. The aim? To make composting as easy as gooi-ing it into the bin. The simple act of composting diverts food waste from landfills, nourishes the Earth, and taps us back into the natural food cycle.
              </p>

              <p>Gooi understands the demands of modern urban life, and the importance of composting. The journey with gooi is more than just a business venture; It's a personal mission, a passion, and a call to arms for all those who believe in a sustainable future. It took decades for recycling to become the norm, but gooi believes composting food waste will be the norm within a handful of years. There are too many benefits to ignore.

              <p>Composting food waste showcases a near perfect system. It is a means to enrich soil, reducing the need for synthetic fertilisers (of which South Africa is currently a net importer), and minimising greenhouse gas emissions. On top of all of that, separating food waste from solid waste streamlines the recycling process, making the treatment of solid waste more efficient and manageable. While recycling aims to mitigate the negative impacts of our consumption patterns, composting food waste takes a proactive approach, actively contributing to ecological health and regeneration. Separating food waste is also a powerful step towards understanding that waste, which in turn can help us to reduce the scale of food waste.

              <p>In the years leading up to the launch of gooi, I was always in search of solutions to improve socio-ecological systems. I looked for answers from traditional farmers and COP attendees, but nothing met my standards. From the world of academia to climate policy conferences, a simple yet impactful solution always seemed elusive. In 2019, while diligently attending to my own food waste, the solution became clear: household composting. If I found it challenging to compost my home's kitchen scraps, surely many people felt the same. A solution was needed.

              <p>Fast forward through the pandemic to 2022 when I met Alfred, a recycling entrepreneur who was hit hard by the rapid rise in the petrol price. Alfred needed another source of income, and I needed support to bring gooi to life. We started with a few, eager zero-waste households who had been waiting for someone to help them manage their organic waste. We provided neat bins that can be kept on a kitchen countertop, and a roll of biodegradable bags to act as bin liners. Once a week Alfred made his rounds through Cape Town, covering neighbourhoods from Camps Bay to Fishhoek. Within six months over 300 litres of organic waste were being diverted each week. We had only skimmed the surface. Now working twice a week to reach all of our compost champions, Alfred delivers the precious nutrients to our gracious composters at Soil for Life in Constantia, as well as some of our own intrepid composters who are looking for the best ways to turn scraps into soil.

              <p>Soil for Life is a non-profit organisation based in Cape Town. Their mission: To teach people how to build and maintain healthy soil; grow nutritious food; and in turn lead healthier more sustainable lives. The organisation offers hands-on training courses and community outreach programs to impart skills and knowledge on natural gardening, composting, and eco-friendly living. Soil for Life emphasises the importance of soil health as a foundation for plant health, which in turn supports human health. They have been involved in various initiatives to uplift communities by promoting home food gardens and sustainable living practices.

              <p>Bringing the dream of gooi to reality has shown me that simple solutions do exist to solve big problems. Nature has always had the answers, and by going back to composting, we're tapping into a natural solution with immense benefits. Places like Soil for Life remind us that by taking care of the soil, we're taking care of our future. But getting your carrot tops and egg shells there hasn't ever been easy. And this is where gooi steps in - making composting easy and accessible for everyone.

              <p>A change as simple as separating your food waste can have a ripple effect that impacts the environment, society, and the biology of all organisms in this unique and precious biosphere. Gooi is a service for you, and the planet. If you don't have an easy way to return your organic waste to the soil I invite you to join me in this venture. As we navigate the complexities of modern life, let's remember the ancient practices of using what we need and returning what we don't to its rightful place.

              <p>"As an undergraduate I focused on modelling and systems thinking with a primary interest in landscape ecology and population modelling. My interest then shifted to socio-economic issues related to climate change, development, and social justice. For my masters thesis I used a social-ecological systems approach to understand the impact of imposed development on a traditional agricultural community in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.

                After dedicating five years to the Future Climate For Africa programme, where I managed the internal and external communications and coordination of five international climate change research teams, I travelled India and South East Asia for almost a year. I then followed a personal passion, molding words into clear communication, focusing on academic editing and proofreading. In 2022 I found the opportunity to begin gooi. And the rest, I hope, will be history.</p>
